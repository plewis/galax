=====

Galax is a program that reads NEXUS-formatted tree files containing tree samples from a
Bayesian phylogenetic posterior distribution and estimates the total Lindley Information
assuming that a non-informative prior was used. It also partitions the total information
among clades.

Note that the behavior of this program may continue to change until version 1.0 is
officially released.

Galax was written to accompany the following paper:

Lewis, PO, MH Chen, L Kuo, LA Lewis, K Fucikova, S Neupane, YB Wang, D Shi. Estimating
Bayesian phylogenetic information content. Systematic Biology manuscript USYB-2014-293
currently under review.
