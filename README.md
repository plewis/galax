=====

Galax is a program that reads NEXUS-formatted tree files containing tree samples from a
Bayesian phylogenetic posterior distribution and estimates the total Lindley Information
assuming that a non-informative prior was used. It also partitions the total information
among clades.

Galax was written to accompany the following paper:

Lewis, PO, MH Chen, L Kuo, LA Lewis, K Fucikova, S Neupane, YB Wang, D Shi. Estimating
Bayesian phylogenetic information content. Systematic Biology manuscript USYB-2014-293
currently under review.

Note that the behavior of version 1.0 of this program may continue to change until the
paper above is published.
