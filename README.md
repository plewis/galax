Galax is a program that reads NEXUS-formatted tree files containing a posterior sample
from a Bayesian phylogenetic MCMC analysis and estimates the total Lindley Information
assuming that a non-informative prior was used. It also partitions the total information
among clades using Larget's conditional clade probability approach.
