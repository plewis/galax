Galax v1.0

Galax is a program that reads NEXUS-formatted tree files containing a posterior sample
from a Bayesian phylogenetic MCMC analysis and estimates the total Lindley Information
assuming that a non-informative prior was used. It also partitions the total information
among clades using Larget's conditional clade probability approach.

Carry out the steps below (in order) to build Galax on a Linux system.

Step 0
------
If you have downloaded Galax from GitHub, you will need to follow all steps below. If you
have downloaded a version that already contains a working configure script (look for a file
named "configure" with no extensions: i.e. "configure.ac" doesn't count), and if you have
boost_1_55_0 or later installed, you may skip directly to step 4.

Step 1
------
Galax requires the Boost libraries program_options and regex. To compile these, download
the latest boost from http://www.boost.org/, then issue this command inside the unpacked
boost directory:

./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=program_options,regex
./b2

Step 2
------
The Boost libraries do not need to be installed on your system; however, you will need to
define the BOOST_ROOT environmental variable to point to your boost installation: e.g.

export BOOST_ROOT="/home/plewis/boost_1_55_0"

Note: the double quotes around the path are important!

Step 3
------
Execute the bootstrap script in order to create the configure script:

./bootstrap

Step 4
------
Run the configure script: the version below will install galax in the bin subdirectory of
your home directory:

./configure --prefix=$HOME
make install

To install galax systemwide,

./configure
make
sudo make install

Step 5
------
This step is needed only if the boost libraries are not installed systemwide. You can
use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable to tell Galax where they are:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$BOOST_ROOT/stage/lib"

Step 6
------
This step is needed only if you want to produce a tar file containing sources:

make dist
