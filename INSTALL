Galax v1.0

Galax is a program that reads NEXUS-formatted tree files containing a posterior sample
from a Bayesian phylogenetic MCMC analysis and estimates the total Lindley Information
assuming that a non-informative prior was used. It also partitions the total information
among clades using Larget's conditional clade probability approach.

Galax requires the Boost libraries program_options and regex. To compile these, download
the latest boost from http://www.boost.org/, then issue this command inside the unpacked
boost directory:

./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=program_options,regex
./b2

The Boost libraries do not need to be installed on your system. Before compiling galax,
define the BOOST_ROOT environmental variable to point to your boost installation: e.g.

export BOOST_ROOT=/home/plewis/boost_1_56_0

To install galax in your local home directory,

./configure --prefix=/home/plewis
make install

To install galax systemwide,

./configure
make
sudo make install
